NoteFlix is an implementation of decentralized music streaming application. This application can be used by users to buy music from the platform or upload music to the platform. This is a smart contract-based application where smart contracts control user registration, the flow of money, as well as flow of data.

### Advantages of Decentralized Platforms over Centralised Platforms:

##### 1. Control of Content :

In centralized platforms, the content published on the platforms is monitored by centralized authorities. These central authorities have control over the censorship 
of content, the may add, remove, update or even ban a users account. This makes a user put there trust in these authorities.

In decentralized platforms, the content creator is the one having complete control of his content. A user can publish his content without any fear of censorship.
Any user can access and pay for content which he wants to listen.

##### 2. Control of Monetization :

These Centralized platforms also control the monetization of the content. The centralization of money always benefits the authorities in control of cash flow.
These authorities use ad revenue from the content creator which makes up a major part of revenue. So, a content creator loses a major part of there revenue to these centralized authorities.

In Decentralized platforms, the user has complete control of money. Once, the user publishes the content, he has complete control over the funds received by his content. If a user's content has funds, he has control to withdraw these funds without middlemen.
