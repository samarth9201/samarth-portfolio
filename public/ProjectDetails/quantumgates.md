We extend the 1-qubit gate synthesis results of Quantum logic gate synthesis as a Markov decision process to multi-qubit systems. We show that the policy iteration Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach used by Alam et al. does not scale to multi-qubit systems, and demonstrate the effectiveness of a different RL technique, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) at single and multi-qubit gate synthesis.
