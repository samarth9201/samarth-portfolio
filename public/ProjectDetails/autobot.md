The robot leveraged computer vision and deep learning for landmark detection, allowing for accurate pose estimation within indoor environments. This facilitated completely autonomous navigation between waypoints while avoiding obstacles. Additionally, an Extended Kalman Filter algorithm was implemented for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to continuously improve the robot's awareness of its surroundings and build maps for navigation.
