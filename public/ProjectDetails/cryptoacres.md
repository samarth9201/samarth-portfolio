Developed an NFT Marketplace utilizing a Layer-2 blockchain solution based on Ethereumâ€™s Plasma chain to enhance scalability and transaction throughput. The implementation leveraged Plasma's sidechain architecture to offload the bulk of transactions from the Ethereum mainnet, significantly reducing gas fees and improving efficiency. Enabled secure and fast minting, buying, and selling of NFTs while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. This approach provided a seamless user experience with improved performance, enabling high-volume transactions without compromising decentralization or security.
