Vector databases store and query high-dimensional vectors, which represent unstructured data such as texts and images in natural language processing and other artificial intelligence applications. However, hosting these vector databases on untrusted clouds exposes the vectors to privacy and security risks, as they may reveal sensitive information about the original data. In this paper, we survey the techniques for securing vector databases, existing similarity search algorithms over encrypted data, security properties and trade-offs of popular vector databases, and directions for future research. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview of the
security challenges and solutions for vector databases.
